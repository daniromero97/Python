# Introduction to object oriented programming (OOP)

- In Python, everything is an "object", but what exactly is an object?.
- Object-oriented programming shows a thought more similar to that of everyday life.

- The bases of object-oriented programming are: abstraction, encapsulation, modularity and hierarchy.

- Object-oriented programming implements these concepts with:
    - Classes and objects
    - Attributes and state
    - Methods
    - Inheritance and polymorphism.


- Object: entity with properties (attributes) stored by the object and specific functionalities (methods).
- Class: abstraction that defines an object by specifying its properties (attributes) and functionalities (methods).


- Example:
    - Our "Person" class has some attributes (name, height, weight, age) and some methods (eating, drinking, sleeping).
    - We can define the attributes and methods that we consider appropriate for the correct functioning of our program.

    - Instantiate an object is to create and define an object.
        > Gonzalo is 1.78 m tall, weighs 74 kg, and is 25 years old.
    - For this we need a constructor, where we will define the attributes of our object.
