# threading

- To execute several simultaneously in the same process we use the class threading.
- Each execution flow is called thread or subprocess.
- Each program that we create has a main thread.
- For each thread there is a pointer.
- The execution of a thread can be stopped temporarily or indefinitely.
- A process will continue to run while at least one thread remains active.

- Running multiple threads is similar to running several programs but with some advantages:
    - The running threads of a process share the same data space as the main thread, so they can access the same information or communicate with each other more easily than if they were in separate processes.
    - Running multiple threads in the same process requires fewer resources than running multiple processes.
    - Simplifies the design of applications that perform concurrent operations.
    

### Define a threads by constructor

- Passing an invokable object to the constructor, as a function.

##### current_thread(), getName(), ident, start()

- current_thread() return the current Thread object, corresponding to the callerâ€™s thread of control. 

##### name, target, args and kwargs

- Use of "target" to pass the name of the function and if the function has arguments we use "args" and "kwargs".
    
    ```
    def count(n_thread, **numbers):
        for i in range(numbers["from"], numbers["until"]):
            print("Thread name %s and identifier %s, thread number %d, number %d" % (
                threading.current_thread().getName(),
                threading.current_thread().ident,
                n_thread,
                i))
    
    for thread_n in range(3):
        thread = threading.Thread(
            name='count',
            target=count,
            args=(thread_n,),
            kwargs={'from': thread_n*30,
                    'until': thread_n*30+5})
        thread.start()
    ```

##### Daemons

- Daemons (special threads), the main thread of the program may end even if one or more child threads have not completed their task.    
- The daemon argument is assigned True when creating the Thread object or it is set with the set_daemon() method.

    ```
    def count10():
        for i in range(10):
            print("Thread name %s and number %d" % (
                threading.current_thread().getName(),
                i))
    
    def count100():
        for i in range(100):
            print("Thread name %s and number %d" % (
                threading.current_thread().getName(),
                i))
    
    
    thread1 = threading.Thread(name='count10',
                             target=count10)
    
    thread2 = threading.Thread(name='count100',
                             target=count100,
                             daemon=True)
    thread1.start()
    thread2.start()
    ```

##### join(), is_alive(), enumerate(), active_count()

- Use of the join() method to make the main thread wait for the daemon thread to complete its work.
    
    ```
    thread.join()
    ```    

- And use the is_alive() method to know if a thread is active or not.

    ```
    thread.is_alive()
    ```    

- active_count() return the number of Thread objects currently alive. 

    ```
    threading.active_count()
    ```
            
- If we want to keep track of the active threads, we will use enumerate(), we must bear in mind that it also returns the main thread and it does not accept certain operations. 

    ```
    def count5():
        for i in range(5):
            print("Thread name %s and number %d" % (
                threading.current_thread().getName(),
                i))
    
    for thread_n in range(0, 5):
        thread = threading.Thread(name=thread_n,
                                   target=count5,
                                   daemon=True)
        thread.start()
    
    
    main_thread = threading.main_thread()
    for thread in threading.enumerate():
        if thread is main_thread:
            continue
    
        print(thread.getName(),
            thread.isDaemon(),
            thread.is_alive(),
            threading.active_count())
    
        thread.join()
    ```   
    
    
### Define a threads creating a class
    
- Creating a class that inherits from Thread in which the run () method or the __init __ () constructor is overwritten.
